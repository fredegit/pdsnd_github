### Project Title
**Bikeshare data analysis**

### Description
The project creates code that lets a user gain information about bikesharing data in Washington, New York City and Chicago.
The user may choose the city, the month and the day of the week that he/she wants to see data analyses for, such as trip durations, most favourite routes, and the like.
Finally the user may choose to see raw data and could start the analysis from scratch for the same or other input parameters for city, month and day of the week.

### Files used
For this project there is mostly raw data required:
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- chicago.csv

And the python file that contains the code for the user input, analyses and outputs:
- bikeshare.py

### Credits
